These are the steps:
1. Save infopath form as .xsn
2. Rename file to .cab and extract
3. Do your changes
4. We need to create a text file (check directives.txt). Check carefully the paths and what is included there.
5. Use a tool called Make-Cab which can be found in C:\Windows\System32\makecab.exe.
   e.g. From command line, go to C:\Windows\System32\. 
        Call MakeCab /f C:\temp\CabScenario\Cab\directives.txt
6. Check the final .xsn
