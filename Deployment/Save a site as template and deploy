Maybe it's an old post but i did the following process to
create the site template:  

1. Deactivate the publishing feature from the site, not from
the site collection.

2. Follow the steps in this post

3. use the template in any site collection.

I have done this and i have been create site collections and
sites with the created site template with no issues, even when it's a different
site collection.Thanks.
