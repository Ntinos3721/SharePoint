Save a SharePoint site as a template

Maybe it's an old post but i did the
following process to create the site template:  
1. Deactivate the publishing feature from the site, not from the
site collection.
2. Follow the steps in this post
3. use the template in any site collection.

I have done this and i have been create site collections and
sites with the created site template with no issues, even when it's a different
site collection.

Thanks.
